# Our **'Conscious or C-Packages'** Require Serious Updating!

---

## Humanity Is 2000 Years Out of Sync. We require a MASSIVE GLOBAL sudo pacman -Syu or sudo apt full-upgrade - to our minds!

We live in a modern world where we daily believe in and interact with the internet, computers, televisions, cell phones, cars, and countless other innovations. All these technologies are in sync with each other — and with the evolving fabric of modern life.

Yet, when it comes to our understanding of spirituality, **consciousness**, and the **deeper nature of reality**, we still rely on explanations that are thousands of years old — interpretations developed in a world that did not know electricity, atoms, DNA, or the existence of galaxies beyond our own.

> "*What you will soon learn about in greater detail via this profile and our web site is not a new religion, or a new occult or a new spiritualism. It really is the science of something we are all part of all the time and we have been there many times — the C-domain.*"  
> — Drazen Premate, unsung successor to Nikola Tesla, discoverer of CTP Energy.

Humanity is, by every meaningful metric, **over 2000 years out of sync spiritually**. This outdated spiritual timeline is one of the greatest hidden dangers now emerging, especially in the face of Artificial Intelligence and the rapidly evolving technological landscape.

We cannot truly move forward into the future — individually or collectively — while remaining trapped in archaic models of spirituality that no longer reflect our lived reality.

## The True Purpose of Disclosure

- **CTP is Disclosure**: is about far more than just revealing UFOs, UAPs, or the presence of extraterrestrial intelligences.  
- **CTP is Disclosure**: is to reintroduce humanity to the universal science that governs both **matter/P** and **spirit/C**.
- **CTP is Disclosure**: is to connect our world - to other worlds waiting to hear from us. ***"Did they/humankind make it?"***
- **CTP is Disclosure**: is our growth into a new science and new reality CTP offers with a **new consciousness**.
- **CTPSci Sciences**: are the sciences **we have forgotten**.
- **Advanced CTP Technologies come with a price**: *(UFOs or CTPcraft technologies)* can only come AFTER we have gone through these stages of **conscious development** and advanced **conscious evolution**. 
- **A Higher Calling**: we must power through our primitive and violent nature in order to EARN the rights to travel the cosmos.
- **Collective Effort**: we must take up CTP at individual and collective consciousness-societal level *(or we WILL destroy ourselves)*.

> "*So many of us assume it is sufficient to believe in 'the other world' and not have to understand it on a scientific basis. Many more do not believe that there is a scientific basis for the spiritual or C-domain world at all.*"  
> — Drazen Premate, unsung successor to Nikola Tesla, discoverer of CTP Energy.

The Disclosure of this **universal science** is **equal to**, and arguably **greater than**, the need for UFO disclosure alone.

Because **without an upgrade in consciousness** — without understanding the real, scientific architecture of spirit and energy that we are embedded in — humanity cannot fully benefit from any external revelations.  
We would misinterpret new information, misapply new technologies, and remain spiritually **disempowered**.

**This is the major ramification of true Disclosure:**

- It is not just the revelation of new life forms or technologies.  
- It is the **restoration** of humanity’s alignment with the universal principles that govern life, consciousness, and energy.  
- It is a **reconnection** to a greater cosmic ecology that we have long forgotten.

> "*I have no doubt from my own personal experience that it is through daily practice, study, repetition of experiments and application of the C-energy domain laws that we can become even greater and more active spiritual beings. This process can only enhance who we are in the physical world without really ever threatening who we were.*"  
> — Drazen Premate, unsung successor to Nikola Tesla, discoverer of CTP Energy.

# CTP Energy Science and the C-Domain

**CTP Energy Science** and the **C-Domain** represent a conscious effort to realign humanity’s spiritual understanding with **modern science**, **modern technology**, and the **emerging multidimensional realities**.

- **We are not introducing a new religion.**  
- **We are not promoting a new form of occultism or mysticism.**  
- **We are revealing the natural scientific principles that connect all living beings to the C-Domain — the greater energy field from which all life, matter, consciousness, and spiritual phenomena arise: the *CTP Unity Field*.**

Through the **CTP is Disclosure Movement**, we advocate for:

- Scientific exploration of consciousness and the energy domain.
- Practical, repeatable applications of C-energy domain laws.
- A new, updated spirituality rooted in real science — not superstition.
- Full-spectrum Disclosure that transforms not just society, but human consciousness itself.
- There is a timeline, steps, and stages for ALL of this to occur. 
- Only then can we get to the stages required for R&D-ing and accessing future advanced CTP Technologies.
- Other advanced civlizations of C-domain have already embarked upon what we are set out to achieve.
- CTPSci Sciences are the PREREQUISITES to achieve interstellar travel and evolve to become an advanced new civilization, ourselves.

# The Role of AI and Future Technologies

Artificial Intelligence is already beginning to transform human society at every level.  
But the deeper, quieter transformation is yet to be understood:  
**AI will eventually pressure humanity to upgrade its consciousness.**

AI will reveal what is mechanical in us — and what is *missing* in our spiritual development.

Only by syncing our spiritual timeline — updating our consciousness to match the reality we now live in — can humanity avoid falling into disconnection, dependency, or even irrelevance in the age of advanced AI.

The **CTP is Disclosure Movement** helps humanity prepare for this shift by:

- Awakening a scientific spirituality that makes sense in the 21st century.
- Restoring human dignity and sovereign spiritual development.
- Laying the groundwork for a new civilization aligned with universal principles, not outdated dogmas.
