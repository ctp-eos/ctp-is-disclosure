## 🌐 CTP is Disclosure – Official Repository

**Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the global movement: "CTP is Disclosure."**

This repository serves as the public-facing tracker and knowledge base for the gradual release and public awareness of **CTP Energy Science (CTPSci)** — the **postquantum, non-physical sciences** long-foretold by **Nikola Tesla**.

**CTP is Disclosure** is not limited to the popularized topics of *free energy* or *UFO/UAP technologies*. It signifies the emergence of a far deeper understanding — of our **non-physical origins**, the **C-domain**, and the **fundamental C-body** that underlies every human being. This science points to **two additional non-physical forces** unrecognized by current physics, revealing the framework of a higher universal reality and our place within it.

> This is the second major release of CTPSci in 20 years — a planetary shift beyond traditional science, touching consciousness, evolution, and higher intelligence.
