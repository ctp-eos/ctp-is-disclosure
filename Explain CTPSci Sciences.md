# CTPSci Sciences

![Alt Text](https://github.com/ctp-eos/ctp-is-disclosure/blob/main/ctpeg-glyph-type.png)

**CTPSci Sciences**, as described in the context of the **CTP-EOS project** *(from the GitHub repository and related sources)*, is a visionary and futuristic framework attributed to Drazen Premate, as Nikola Tesla’s intellectual successor. CTP/CTP Energy/CTPSci Sciences are revolutionary scientific paradigm, purportedly 50 years ahead of contemporary science, focusing on the interplay of consciousness, non-physical energies, and advanced technologies. Below is an explanation:

## Core Concepts of CTPSci Sciences

### C-Domain and C-Energy
- **C-domain** as a non-physical, multiverse-like framework that encompasses both physical and non-physical realities. It represents a higher-order reality where **consciousness** and **energy** operate beyond *conventional* physics.
- **C-energy** ***(or [CTP Energy](https://ctp-energy.com))*** is the total force or energy system that spans physical and non-physical domains. It is the foundational concept for CTPSci Sciences, driving technologies like propulsion systems and energy cycles.

### Consciousness as a Central Pillar
- CTPSci Sciences emphasizes consciousness as a fundamental aspect of reality, not merely a byproduct of physical processes. It explores the "C-spiritual" or conscious mind as a tool for interfacing with advanced CTP Technologies.
- The sciences aim to teach individuals how to engage with the C-domain through conscious awareness, enabling interaction with non-physical systems and technologies.

### Non-Physical Technologies
- CTPSci Sciences claims to develop technologies rooted Ascendancy to non-physical realms. Examples include:
  - **CTP Gravitic Propulsion Systems**: Advanced propulsion technology for interstellar travel, such as **CTP Spaceliners**, which are envisioned as spacecraft for exploring the multiverse.
  - **CTP Energy Cycles**: Systems for harnessing C-energy, potentially for powering advanced technologies.
- These technologies are described as operating in the C-domain, requiring a deep understanding of consciousness to function.

### Post-Quantum Leap and Nth Industrial Revolution
- CTPSci Sciences is positioned as a catalyst for a **post-quantum leap**, a transformative shift in human understanding and capability, surpassing current quantum physics.
- It aims to usher in the **Nth Industrial Revolution**, a new era of technological and societal advancement driven by CTP technologies and consciousness-based sciences.

## Key Applications

- **Interstellar Travel**: The development of [**CTP Spaceliners**](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7162263158424870912) for exploring the multiverse, leveraging gravitic propulsion systems. *(Note: [cigar-shaped UFOs](https://x.com/search?q=cigar-shaped%20ufo&src=typed_query) ARE* ***CTP Spaceliners!*** *(that utilize CTP Gravitic Propulsion)* 
- **Energy Systems**: Novel energy solutions based on C-energy, potentially replacing conventional energy sources.
- **Conscious Interfaces**: Systems that require users to master CTPSci’s consciousness principles to operate advanced technologies, such as the non-physical operating system in Part III of CTP-EOS.

## Philosophical and Visionary Aspects
- CTPSci Sciences blends scientific ambition with metaphysical and spiritual elements, drawing parallels to esoteric or New Age concepts while grounding them in a techno-futurist narrative.
- It envisions a future where humanity achieves **interstellar nationhood**, with CTPSci as the guiding science for this evolution.
- The framework encourages community participation *(e.g., through **CTP Energy Linux Community Project**)* and sponsorship to build a collective movement toward this vision with a ***Disclosure*** themed Linux distro **everyone** can use!

## Context and Credibility
- **Attribution to Drazen Premate**: Presented as a visionary scientist, indeed, unsung successor to Nikola Tesla our world ignored/(dis)missed during Drazen's time here
- *Note: (Drazen passed alone and destitute similar to Nikola Tesla in 2019 - at the age of 63 without ever realizing his vision of CTP Energy)* as no widely recognized academic or scientific credentials are provided in mainstream sources. For a reason... 'CTP' IS the ***'Disclosure'*** science!
- 'What' [Steven Greer](https://drstevengreer.com/) has referred to as ***Conscious Assisted Technologies*** ARE the **CTP Technologies!**
- **Speculative Nature**: CTPSci Sciences operates outside *conventional* scientific paradigms.
- **Not based on terrestrial physics**: Advanced CTP Gravitic Propulsion Systems *(to come later)* are NOT based on principles of *known* terrestrial physics as presently understood: [The Five Observables](https://fiveobservables.com/)
- **Open-Source Integration**: The CTP-EOS project ties CTPSci to tangible outputs, like the Arch-based Linux distribution, to lend credibility and attract a tech-savvy audience.

## Summary
CTPSci Sciences is a visionary *'next century'* framework that combines advanced scientific concepts *(e.g., gravitic propulsion, post-quantum physics)* with **consciousness** and non-physical energy systems connect to our physical world via CTP Energy *(C-energy, C-domain)*. 

CTP aims to revolutionize technology and human evolution, enabling interstellar travel and a new industrial era. Ambitious and imaginative, blending open-source software development with futuristic, post-metaphysical ideas. Its practical manifestations, like the CTP-EOS Linux distribution *(presently in development)*, serve as entry points to engage communities with its broader vision: for humankind/CTP to achieve private/commercial/industrial level **interstellar travel** in our lifetime.
