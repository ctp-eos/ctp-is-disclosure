# CTP ENERGY AND THE ORIGINS OF CONSCIOUSNESS-BASED (NON)PHYSICS  
### *How Drazen’s CTP Model Predated and Surpassed Hoffman’s Conscious Realism*

---

## 🔍 Overview

The rise of consciousness-first science is one of the most radical paradigm shifts in the history of physics. While mainstream science continues to search for a unified theory of everything based on matter, space-time, and quantum mechanics, a bold new school of thought proposes that **consciousness itself is more fundamental than space-time**[^1].

Among the best-known voices in this arena is **Dr. Donald Hoffman**, who has earned global recognition for his "Conscious Realism" and "Conscious Agent Theory"[^2]. But years before Hoffman formalized his views, **Drazen introduced a comprehensive and aligned cosmological system** called **CTP Energy**.

Publicly revealed in **October 2004**, the **CTP Energy Model** predated Hoffman’s 2008 paper and offered **a far more expansive scientific framework**, rooted in decades of research into non-physical energy domains, emergent time, and the primacy of consciousness.

## 🧠 1. Conscious Realism: A New Interface Theory of Perception

Dr. Donald Hoffman, a cognitive scientist at UC Irvine, developed his theory of **Conscious Realism** in the mid-2000s. His key paper, *"Conscious Realism and the Mind-Body Problem"*, was published in *Mind and Matter* in 2008[^2].

Hoffman proposes:

- **Space-time is not fundamental** — it is a perceptual "user interface."
- **Physical objects do not exist independently** of conscious observation.
- **Conscious agents** are the basic ontological units of reality.
- Evolution shapes perception *not* to reveal truth, but to enable survival[^3].

Later expanded in his book *[The Case Against Reality](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0393254690?tag=ctpenergy03-20)*[^4], Hoffman’s work draws heavily from **evolutionary game theory, mathematical modeling, and cognitive psychology**. His theory has garnered attention from both the physics and consciousness studies communities.

While provocative and innovative, **Hoffman’s work is philosophical and cognitive in origin**, lacking the integrated cosmological and energetic mechanics found in the CTP Energy framework.

## 🧬 2. CTP Energy: A Deeper, Earlier Theory of Conscious Cosmos

### 📜 Historical Roots

Drazen’s CTP Energy Model is the result of more than **20 years of pre-2004 research** into the deeper structures of consciousness, time, and energy. Publicly introduced in **October 2004**, it builds on original work started as early as the **1980s**, making it **a full four years ahead of Hoffman’s publication** and arguably two decades ahead in scope[^5].

### 🔺 The CTP Triad

At its core, the CTP framework posits that the universe arises from the interplay of three energy domains *(in CTP reality-two)*:

| Energy Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **C-energy (Conscious-Energy)** | Non-physical information field. Carries awareness, intelligence, and perception. |
| **T-energy (Translational-Energy)** | Non-physical but dynamic. Responsible for time flow, causality, and emergence/'rendering'. |
| **P-energy (Physical-Energy)** | Traditional energy/matter fields governed by known physics. |

These are not metaphors or abstractions; they are **fundamental forces** with distinct roles in a **cyclical relational model**—the **CTP Energy Cycle**.

### 🔄 The CTP Energy Cycle

In the CTP framework, the universe is constantly renewed via the interaction of:

- **C-energy Units** → Information-intelligent structures (awareness nodes)  
- **T-energy Units** → Causal change agents across timelines (reality domain connector or 'bridge')  
- **P-energy Units** → Observable physical particles or energy states  

Each of these operates **under its own laws**, yet influences the others in a cycle that:

1. Generates emergent phenomena (space-time, biology, consciousness)
2. Enables self-organizing systems
3. Allows cross-domain feedback (e.g., mind-over-matter effects[^6])

## 🧭 4. Consciousness-Carriers vs. Conscious Agents

At the heart of both systems is a shared intuition: **consciousness is fundamental**. But how it’s modeled differs drastically:

- **Hoffman’s conscious agents**: Probabilistic, interact via formal equations, exist as cognitive constructs[^2].
- **Drazen’s C-energy units**: Energetically real, interact via C-force, produce awareness and perception dynamically.

> **CTP doesn’t just describe consciousness — it provides a new energetic field for it.**

The **T-energy** dimension is also entirely unique to CTP, accounting for phenomena such as:

- Time loops[^7]  
- Non-linear causality  
- Retrocausality[^8]  
- Conscious time dilation  
- Dream state physics[^9]  

---

## 🔧 5. Scientific and Technological Implications of CTP

Because CTP includes defined **forces, fields, and relational units**, it is **not merely philosophical**—it opens the door to experimental and technological innovation, such as:

- Quantum/consciousness hybrid devices[^10]  
- T-energy field modulation (time effects)  
- C-energy resonance-based AI systems  
- Non-physical energy healing platforms[^11]  
- Post-quantum information storage using C-units[^12]
- CTP Gravitic Propulsion Systems *(advanced forms of future space travel and CTP space propulsion systems)*

By comparison, **Hoffman’s model does not lend itself to engineering** — it is an interpretation framework, not a physical model.

## 📅 6. Historical Significance and Priority

| Milestone                         | CTP Energy                         | Conscious Realism             |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Initial Research Start           | Early 1980s                        | Mid-2000s                     |
| Public Reveal                    | October 2004                       | 2008 Publication              |
| Introduction of Conscious Units | Yes – C-units and T-units          | Yes – Conscious Agents        |
| Introduction of Novel Forces     | Yes – C-force and T-force          | No                            |
| Full Cosmological Model          | Yes – CTP Cycle and Unified Physics| No                            |

The **CTP Energy Model** is **both historically and scientifically prior** to Conscious Realism. It provides a more comprehensive and actionable vision of how consciousness and time interrelate with physics.

## 🏁 Conclusion: CTP Energy is the Foundation

> "CTP Energy is not just a theory. It is a unified physics of consciousness, time, and reality."

While Hoffman popularized a powerful idea, **Drazen’s CTP Energy laid the groundwork years earlier**, offering a system ready for science, experimentation, and technology. *(Our world simply was not ready for CTP even in the wake of ['WhatTheBleePDoWeKnow'](https://watchdocumentaries.com/what-the-bleep-do-we-know/))*

The scientific revolution won’t start with equations alone — it will start with those willing to rethink the very structure of space, time, and the mind.
