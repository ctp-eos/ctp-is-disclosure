## 🌐 CTP is Disclosure – Official Repository

**Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the global movement: "CTP is Disclosure."**

This repository serves as the public-facing tracker and knowledge base for the gradual release and public awareness of **CTP Energy Science (CTPSci)** — the **postquantum, non-physical sciences** long-foretold by **Nikola Tesla**. ***"The day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will make more progress in one decade than in all the previous centuries of its existence.***" - Nikola Tesla, predicting the arrival of CTPSci. 

**CTP is Disclosure** is not limited to the popularized topics of *free energy* or *UFO/UAP technologies*. 

CTP Energy signifies the emergence of a far deeper understanding — of our **non-physical origins**, the non-physical **C-domain**, and the **fundamental C-body** that underlies every human being to the **non-physical C-energy** that exists behind the creation of every physical object and/of **everything** and **everyone**. 

CTPSci Sciences points to **two additional non-physical forces** unrecognized by current physics, revealing the framework of a much higher and much larger universal reality and our place within it.

> This is the second major release of CTPSci in 20 years — a planetary shift beyond traditional science, touching consciousness, evolution, and higher intelligence.

### What You'll Find Here:
- 🧠 Core concepts and summaries of **CTP Energy Science**  
- 📈 Tracking of media coverage, public response, and social discussion  
- 📜 Milestones in the ongoing [**CTP is Disclosure Movement**](https://github.com/ctp-eos/ctp-idm)
- 🔭 Educational outreach and community awareness initiatives  
- 🚀 Research into the **C-domain**, higher consciousness, and extraterrestrial-grade intelligence

**CTP is Disclosure** is humanity's next evolutionary step: a conscious, science-driven awakening to our true multidimensional reality. **UFO/UAP** CTP Gravitic Propulsion Systems are also based on the advanced CTPSci Sciences. CTP Energy is PREREQUISITE/required to control/modulate Gravity *(as a propulsor)* to achieve **CTP Gravitic Propulsion**. **UFOs/UAPs** or **<a href="https://x.com/search?q=ctp%20craft&src=typed_query" target="_blank">CTP craft</a>**
are based on THIS: the CTPSci Sciences, discovered by Drazen.
