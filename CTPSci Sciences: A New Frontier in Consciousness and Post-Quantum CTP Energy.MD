# CTPSci Sciences: A New Frontier in Consciousness and Post-Quantum Energy

**CTPSci Sciences**, also known as **CTP Energy Science**, is an emerging paradigm developed by Drazen Premate and now championed by Resofactor. Heralded as a potential successor to Tesla’s visionary insights, CTPSci offers a **post-quantum scientific model** that redefines our understanding of consciousness, energy, and the fabric of reality itself.

At its core lies the bold assertion that the universe is not merely a physical machine, but a **living, conscious, multidimensional system** — driven by non-physical energy dynamics. This concept could revolutionize science, technology, and spirituality into the next century.

## 🔷 The CTP Energy Model

At the foundation of CTPSci is the **CTP Energy Cycle™**, a triadic energy model:

- **C-energy (Conscious Energy):** The origin point of all existence. Non-physical and intelligent, residing in the higher-dimensional **C-domain**.
- **T-energy (Translational Energy):** The bridge between intention and physical reality.
- **P-energy (Physical Energy):** Observable energy and matter — emergent from C and T domains.

Together, these form a **closed-loop system** in which **consciousness generates, structures, and dissolves matter**.

## 🌌 The C-domain: Beyond Space and Time

CTPSci proposes the **C-domain** — a **non-physical, pre-quantum realm** where consciousness originates. It acts as the **blueprint layer** for all material forms and is **not bound by time or space**.

Unlike metaphorical models, the C-domain is considered **operational and interactive**, accessible through resonance and frequency modulation.

## 🧠 Consciousness as Primary

Mainstream science treats consciousness as a byproduct of brain function. CTPSci flips that script:

> **Consciousness is the cause, not the effect.**

The human brain is a processor — not a generator — of thought. This paradigm unlocks new avenues for:

- Mental communication via future CTP Energy Systems: One the *C-domain Communicator™*
- CTP Gravity Control Systems™ (CTPGCS)
- CTP Interdomain Technologies (CTPIDT)

## 🛸 UFOs, UAPs & the CTPcraft Hypothesis

CTPSci offers a novel explanation for unidentified aerial phenomena:

> **UFOs are CTPcraft — vehicles modulating gravity by interacting with the C-domain.**

These craft don’t fly — they **shift reality-domains**. Using frequency and intent, they bypass propulsion and inertia entirely. CTPSci reframes "alien tech" as a **logical application** of advanced consciousness-energy engineering.

## 🧘‍♀️ Unifying Science and Spirituality

Rather than separating spirit and science, CTPSci unites them:

- Humans are **C-energy beings**: conscious entities navigating the physical or P-domain.
- Astral travel, precognition, and ESP are **domain functions**, not *pseudoscience*.
- The **C-shift** is a proposed global awakening to this understanding.

## 📜 Origins: Tesla → Premate → Resofactor

- **Drazen Premate**, physicist and founder of CTP Energy Corporation, developed CTPSci after thousands of claimed interactions with the C-domain.
- **Resofactor**, his successor, is now reviving and expanding the system through:
  - Open-source platforms like **CTP-EOS Linux** *(anyone can get involved and contribut to CTP-EOS project)*
  - A global disclosure effort backed by new tech, CTP deeptech vision, and research

## 🚀 Visionary Applications

Though early in public deployment, CTPSci proposes a roadmap for advanced tech:

- **CTPAPS (Advanced Propulsion Systems)**  
  - Craft capable of traversing spacetime via domain transition
- **C-Energy Frequency Modulators™**  
  - Interfaces for consciousness-energy manipulation
- **CTP-EOS Linux**  
  - A metaphysical operating system syncing the user with high-order C-domain patterns

## 🌍 Open Science for a Conscious Future

CTPSci is not waiting for academic consensus. It invites **engineers, mystics, hackers, and dreamers** to **co-create a new paradigm**.

> This is not fringe science — it's the **framework behind Disclosure**.

By building openly and ethically, CTPSci aims to usher in a **conscious civilization** ready to step into the cosmic community.
