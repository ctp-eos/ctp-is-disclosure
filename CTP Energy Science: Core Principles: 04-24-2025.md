# CTP Energy Science: Core Principles

CTP Energy Science (CTPSci) is a theoretical framework introduced by Reso Factor, based on original discoveries by an individual named Drazen in 1985. It positions itself as a science of non-physical phenomena, in direct alignment with Nikola Tesla‚Äôs vision of transcending conventional physics.

## üß¨ Origins and Background

- **Initial Discovery**: CTPSci was established in March 1985 by Drazen. Reso Factor has continued research and development since 2011 as part of its second emergence.
- **Tesla‚Äôs Vision Realized**: Aligned with Nikola Tesla‚Äôs prophetic insight ‚Äî  
  > *‚ÄúThe day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will make more progress in one decade than in all the previous centuries of its existence.‚Äù*[^1]

## üß≠ Core Principles

### 1. CTP Energy and the C-Domain

- **C-Energy**: The foundational energy of the universe, operating within the "C-domain" ‚Äî a domain beyond the known physical ("P-domain") realm.
- **Functional Role**: C-Energy governs interactions that transcend the traditional four forces of physics[^2]. It provides a medium for the emergence of consciousness-driven phenomena.

### 2. Non-Physical Phenomena

- **Primary Focus**: CTPSci confirms that **consciousness is a fundamental force**, directly embedded in the structure of the universe[^3].
- **Illustrative Case**: Examples such as coordinated bird murmurations are explained via C-Energy fields, illustrating intelligent collective behavior beyond biological instinct.

### 3. Gravitic Propulsion and CTPcraft

- **Propulsion Redefined**: CTPcraft use C-Energy to modulate gravitational fields, enabling propulsion without combustion or traditional thrust.
- **Flight Characteristics**: This explains observed UFO/UAP behaviors such as rapid acceleration, sudden stops, and angular deflections without inertia.

### 4. Expansion Beyond the Standard Model

- **Beyond Four Forces**: CTPSci introduces at least two additional fundamental forces enabled by non-physical C-Energy and T-energy.
- **Redefining Gravity**: Gravity is influenced by consciousness-based interactions, not merely by mass-curved spacetime.

### 5. Future Applications (CTPSCIA)

- **CTPSci-Inspired Technologies**: Applications range from advanced propulsion systems to software platforms like Bitwig that interface with consciousness-driven dynamics.
- **Collective Human Potential**: Group coherence and bio-emotional resonance fields are practical expressions of CTP-based dynamics.

## üõ∏ Verified Phenomenological Connections

- **UFO/UAP Confirmations**: CTPSci fully accounts for and explains confirmed phenomena like the **Tic Tac encounters of 2004 and 2024**[^4].
- **Conscious Coordination**: Natural group behaviors (e.g., schools of fish, insect swarms) are interpreted as expressions of C-Energy interconnectivity.
